# INFO2300 - Assignment 3 
Student Name: John Isabelo Aldeguer

# About the Project
I used my old project for this assignment and I add some changes to the file.
This project is all about calculations of Area of Square, Triangle including Volume of Cube and Sphere.

# Developer Side Note
This is an older version of .net Framework so it may or may not have an issue on the later project.
I tried to add a Unit Test but it keeps getting failed due to different version of my .net Framework
I'm still struggle to release in git and github but I will try on the next project to push nice and smoothly.

# Instruction how to run
I separate the files and my executable files. Download the A2JohnAldeguerP2.exe but first you must disable the anti-virus it might or might not detected the exe file as a virus. After you download the exe file. Open it and the instruction on how to use its on the program itself. Read and follow it well.

# Demonstrate Understanding of Version control
We need to do a test environment to keep control of the software that is running smoothly until to the presentation day including the features, database servers, different devices to use that may compatible on the software.
